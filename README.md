Node.js Docker App
This is a Node.js application containerized using Docker. It provides a simple REST API or web server (customize based on your app).

Features
Node.js runtime environment.

Dockerized for easy deployment and development.

REST API endpoints (if applicable).

Environment variable support for configuration.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

Docker (v20 or higher recommended)

Docker Compose (optional, for multi-container setups)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/sinhaas2411/Fusion.git
cd Fusion
2. Install Dependencies
Install the Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

env
Copy
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
# Add other environment variables here
Running the Application
Option 1: Run Locally (Without Docker)
Start the application locally:

bash
Copy
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Option 2: Run with Docker
Build and run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
docker build -t node-docker-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 node-docker-app
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Option 3: Run with Docker Compose
If you have a multi-container setup (e.g., with a database), use Docker Compose:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints (if applicable)
If your app is a REST API, document the endpoints here. For example:

GET /api/users - Fetch all users.

POST /api/users - Create a new user.

GET /api/users/:id - Fetch a specific user by ID.

Environment Variables
List the environment variables used in your app:

PORT: The port on which the app runs (default: 3000).

NODE_ENV: The environment mode (development, production, etc.).

Add other variables as needed.

Docker Configuration
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the Node.js app.

docker-compose.yml: Defines the multi-container setup (if applicable).

Development
Running Tests
Run the test suite:

bash
Copy
npm test
Linting
Check the code for linting errors:

bash
Copy
npm run lint
Debugging
To debug the app, use:

bash
Copy
npm run debug
Deployment
Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image for production:

bash
Copy
docker build -t node-docker-app:production .
Push to Docker Registry
Push the image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub):

bash
Copy
docker tag node-docker-app:production your-dockerhub-username/node-docker-app:production
docker push your-dockerhub-username/node-docker-app:production
Deploy to a Cloud Platform
Deploy the Docker image to a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
